# Introduction to Image Classification using Deep Learning with PyTorch


This code implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch for image classification tasks. It begins by preprocessing image data with standard transformations, setting up datasets and loaders for efficient processing. The CNN architecture, named "ImageMulticlassClassificationNet," integrates convolutional and fully connected layers to analyze images and make predictions.

During training, the model optimizes its parameters using the Adam optimizer and minimizes the cross-entropy loss function. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, loss, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed to assess the model's performance on test data. Additionally, the code facilitates single-image inference, demonstrating how the trained model predicts classes for new images after preprocessing.

A visual representation of the model's architecture (model_graph.png) is generated using torchviz, offering insights into its structural components.
